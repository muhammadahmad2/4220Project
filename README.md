# 4220Project

CSCI 4220 Project

The goal of the project is to identify and locate faces in a video using opencv.

I will be using the eigenfaces method provided at https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html

Use sample data to train a model. Project all training samples into the PCA subspace. Then project the query image into the PCA subspace. Finding the nearest neighbor between the projected training images and the projected query image

Use this on each frame of the video. Same method as for images.
